3.	Treatment of numerical variables (standardization and normality distribution check)
4.	Visualization of the features and target (boxplots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps)
5.	Treatment of outliers
6.	Correlations and multicollinearity between features
7.	Building models with hyperparameters (Logistic Regression, SCV and Random Forest Classification)
8.	Comparing models and analyzing metrics (e.g. accuracy, precision and recall).
